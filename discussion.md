6.1 Interpretation of Clustered Operational Profiles
The clustered operational profiles delineate distinct service roles across administrative units, anchored in the relative prominence of enrolment, demographic updates, and biometric maintenance. The lowest-intensity grouping corresponds to centers with balanced, predictable workloads, typical of districts exhibiting stable populations and incremental organic growth. In these units, enrolment and routine updates progress in tandem, and biometric maintenance follows scheduled cycles without imposing acute strain. A second, more active grouping processes substantial volumes of both new enrolments and demographic updates, consistent with urban and peri-urban contexts where natural growth coexists with steady inflows of newcomers. These centers function as hybrid nodes that must shift efficiently between onboarding and record modification, and their diversified transaction mix implies operational flexibility as a core requirement. The most stressed grouping is defined by pronounced demographic update activity relative to enrolment, indicating service environments where maintenance dominates over identity creation and where already-enrolled residents seek to synchronize credentials with new locations or life-stage changes. Biometric maintenance overlays all groups, introducing episodic peaks tied to age-based requirements that can amplify transient stress in update-heavy locations. The Update-to-Enrolment Ratio operates as a normalization lens: elevated ratios in the stressed grouping are consistent with migration-driven pressure, signaling that operational emphasis has shifted from onboarding to keeping digital identities aligned with rapidly changing residential and demographic realities. The distribution shown in Figure 1 underscores how a minority of units bear disproportionate stress, while Figure 2 visually separates balanced centers from update-dominant hubs and highlights the distinct operational wing formed by migration-driven centers. Figure 3 further contextualizes these profiles geographically, showing where migration pressure concentrates at the state level and reinforcing the linkage between elevated ratios and update-heavy demand.

6.2 Migration-Induced Infrastructure Stress
The clustering outcomes indicate a spatial mismatch between service demand and installed capacity that aligns with internal migration patterns. Destination districts experiencing inflows exhibit heavier update workloads than static population models would imply, whereas origin districts with outflows retain comparatively balanced or lower update pressure. This asymmetry suggests that infrastructure distribution reflects legacy baselines rather than current mobility, leaving capacity anchored where demand has diminished and creating congestion where demand has intensified. Static, census-based planning assumes slow demographic change and thus lags the velocity of contemporary labor and residential movement. Consequently, centers in high-inflow areas accumulate update queues and elongated processing times, whereas units in lower-demand regions remain underutilized. The divergence between update-dominant and balanced centers, visible in the bifurcated trajectories of Figure 2, is consistent with a provisioning cadence that does not adjust to real-time demand geography. Additionally, operational stress is shaped by workload composition, not merely absolute volume: demographic updates often involve documentation and address verification, which can introduce variability and delay. Where such tasks concentrate, even moderate totals can generate disproportionate strain. Conversely, idle capacity in origin districts underscores inefficiency in static allocation. The heatmap in Figure 3 reinforces this interpretation by contrasting high-pressure industrial corridors with regions exhibiting slack capacity. The temporal pattern in Figure 4 indicates that stress is episodic as well as spatial, with predictable surges linked to life-stage or school-cycle events; such seasonality amplifies congestion in already stressed centers when planning does not anticipate cyclical peaks. Together, these visuals suggest a system whose infrastructure cadence trails the rhythm of migration and scheduled maintenance, producing localized bottlenecks alongside underused assets.

6.3 Comparison with Existing Literature
Studies of migration and public service delivery frequently rely on decadal census data or episodic surveys to infer population shifts and infrastructure needs. While valuable for long-run trends, these sources lack the temporal resolution to reveal short-term fluctuations that drive operational stress in administrative systems. A transaction-level perspective offers higher-frequency insight, mitigating recall bias and aggregation artifacts inherent in survey-based approaches. By examining actual enrolment, demographic update, and biometric maintenance events, the findings surface intra-urban and intra-rural heterogeneity that aggregate categories often obscure. This granularity complements facility-location and capacity-planning literature by distinguishing maintenance-heavy demand from growth-driven enrolment, a nuance commonly collapsed in aggregate service metrics. Normalized indicators allow comparisons across diverse administrative units, extending earlier work that maps migration corridors without quantifying their operational footprint on specific service nodes. The cluster patterns align with established observations that migration concentrates demand in specific destinations, yet add operational specificity by linking that demand to the dominance of updates over enrolments. Figures 1 and 2 visually echo themes from the literature on uneven urbanization by depicting both the proportional imbalance of stressed units and the distinct operational wing of migration-driven hubs. The spatial concentration shown in Figure 3 parallels prior accounts of industrial-corridor pull factors, while the cyclical surges visible in Figure 4 resonate with literature on seasonal service peaks tied to education and life-course milestones. The anomaly scatter in Figure 5 further complements discussions on data quality and fraud risk by highlighting improbable operational patterns that conventional demographic instruments might miss, situating this study’s transaction-based approach as a complementary lens that can detect both structural stress and irregular outliers.

6.4 Implications for Digital Governance
The differentiated profiles underscore the strategic value of administrative transaction data as a decision-support asset for large-scale digital public infrastructure. As enrolment saturation is reached, lifecycle management emerges as the primary workload, shifting the operational frontier from onboarding to maintenance. Monitoring normalized stress indicators—such as the relative intensity of updates—can provide early signals of emerging pressure points, enabling responsive adjustments before congestion becomes entrenched. Persistent heterogeneity across centers implies that uniform operational policies risk inefficiency; instead, adaptive oversight that detects and responds to localized imbalances can enhance resilience. Transaction-level visibility also permits more precise alignment of capacity, software configurations, and support resources with observed workload composition, without altering the core identity architecture. The coherence between analytical findings and visual evidence in Figures 1 through 5 indicates that administrative data can ground more agile and context-sensitive management of digital identity services. Visualizing proportional stress (Figure 1), operational bifurcation (Figure 2), geographic concentration (Figure 3), temporal surges (Figure 4), and outlier patterns (Figure 5) provides complementary vantage points that together inform prioritization of monitoring and support. While specific interventions remain outside the scope of this section, the study’s objective—characterizing migration-driven operational stress—is advanced by demonstrating that high-frequency administrative signals and their graphical summaries can inform more responsive and differentiated governance of mature digital public infrastructure in the face of evolving population movements. In effect, the visuals operationalize abstract stress indicators into actionable situational awareness, suggesting that continuous, evidence-based oversight is necessary to keep identity services aligned with the mobility and maintenance realities they are intended to support.
