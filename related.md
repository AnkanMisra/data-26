The optimization of national identity infrastructure intersects with multiple domains of research, including migration studies, public facility location modeling, and the application of machine learning in governance. This section reviews existing literature in these areas to contextualize the challenges of dynamic resource allocation and highlights the specific gaps addressed by the proposed framework.

### 2.1 Internal Migration and Public Service Demand

Internal migration in developing economies has been extensively studied through the lens of demographic transition and economic labor flows. Traditional research relies heavily on decadal census data and large-scale sample surveys to map migration corridors. Scholars have characterized migration patterns as primarily driven by economic disparities, with significant rural-to-urban shifts impacting the demand for urban public services. Studies leveraging census data provide valuable macro-level insights into long-term population redistribution but suffer from significant temporal latency. Since census data is collected infrequently, it fails to capture high-frequency, seasonal, or circular migration patterns that directly affect the daily operational load of public service centers.

More recent approaches have utilized alternative data sources, such as mobile call detail records (CDRs) and railway passenger data, to estimate population mobility with greater temporal resolution. While these methods offer improvements over static census data, they often lack the granularity required for administrative planning. Mobile network data, for instance, raises privacy concerns and does not directly correlate with the demand for specific administrative services like identity updates. Furthermore, survey-based studies on migrant access to social security highlight the administrative barriers faced by mobile populations but typically stop short of proposing quantitative methods for infrastructure optimization. Consequently, there remains a disconnect between the sociological understanding of migration and the operational requirement to adapt service delivery infrastructure in real-time.

### 2.2 Optimization of Public Infrastructure and Service Centers

The problem of locating and sizing public service facilities falls within the broader domain of facility location problems (FLP) and operations research. Classic models, such as the p-median and covering location models, optimize facility placement by minimizing the distance between service centers and the target population. In the context of e-governance and citizen service centers, researchers have applied these models to maximize coverage and minimize access costs. However, the majority of these optimization frameworks operate under the assumption of static demand or predictable growth rates based on historical averages.

Literature on capacity planning in public services acknowledges the challenge of fluctuating demand but often addresses it through queuing theory and staffing optimization within fixed locations, rather than dynamic resource reallocation across a network. In scenarios involving rapid urbanization or disaster-induced displacement, static facility location models fail to prevent service bottlenecks. Research indicates that rigidity in public infrastructure planning leads to significant inefficiencies, where facilities in source regions become underutilized while destination regions experience severe congestion. Despite the theoretical advancements in dynamic facility location, empirical applications in the context of large-scale biometric identity systems remain limited. The specific operational nuance of identity systems—where demand types vary between new enrolments and maintenance updates—adds a layer of complexity not adequately addressed by general-purpose facility location literature.

### 2.3 Machine Learning in Governance and Administrative Systems

The adoption of data analytics and machine learning in public administration has grown significantly, driven by the increasing digitization of government records. In the domain of governance analytics, unsupervised learning techniques have been widely employed for segmentation and pattern recognition. Clustering algorithms, such as K-Means and hierarchical clustering, have been used to categorize administrative units based on socio-economic indicators, enabling targeted policy interventions. Similarly, anomaly detection algorithms have found applications in identifying fraud in taxation, welfare distribution, and procurement systems.

However, the application of these techniques to the operational logs of national identity systems is less explored. Existing studies on biometric systems primarily focus on the technical performance of matching algorithms, security protocols, and deduplication efficiency. There is a paucity of research that utilizes the metadata of administrative transactions—such as timestamps, location codes, and transaction types—to model the operational health of the infrastructure itself. While clustering has been used to profile citizen demographics, its potential to segment service centers based on operational stress profiles remains largely untapped. The intersection of unsupervised learning and administrative log analysis offers a promising avenue for creating responsive, data-driven governance structures.

### 2.4 Research Gap and Positioning of This Study

A synthesis of the existing literature reveals a critical gap in the management of national identity infrastructure. While migration studies explain the movement of people and operations research provides tools for static facility placement, there is a lack of integrated frameworks that use real-time administrative data to drive dynamic resource allocation. Current approaches either rely on outdated census data, leading to a mismatch between supply and demand, or utilize high-level proxy data that does not reflect specific administrative workloads.

Furthermore, most existing optimization models do not distinguish between the heterogeneous types of demand inherent in identity systems. The operational difference between a new enrolment and a demographic update is significant, yet standard metrics often aggregate these into a single volume count. This study addresses these limitations by introducing a novel, data-driven framework that leverages granular transaction logs. By applying unsupervised learning to classify operational stress and detect anomalies, this research bridges the gap between static infrastructure planning and dynamic demographic reality, positioning administrative metadata as a central tool for operational efficiency in digital governance.
