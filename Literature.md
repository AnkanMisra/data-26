## 2. Literature Review

The optimization of national identity infrastructure intersects with migration studies, public facility location modeling, and governance analytics. This section contextualizes dynamic resource allocation challenges and highlights gaps addressed by the proposed framework.

### 2.1 Internal Migration and Public Service Demand
Internal migration in developing economies is traditionally analyzed using decadal census data or large-scale surveys to map labor flows and urbanization. While valuable for long-term policy, these sources suffer from significant temporal latency, failing to capture the high-frequency seasonal or circular migration that directly impacts daily public service loads. Furthermore, traditional instruments often undercount floating populations in urban centers, leading to systematic underestimation of service demand in industrial hubs. The exclusion risks are particularly acute for low-income migrants who rely on portable welfare schemes like "One Nation One Ration Card," which require up-to-date address authentication. When local administrative centers are overwhelmed by undocumented inflows, these vulnerable groups face disproportionately high rejection rates and extended wait times, effectively locking them out of the social safety net. Recent studies utilizing alternative data sources, such as call detail records (CDRs) or transit data, offer improved temporal resolution but lack the granularity required for administrative planning. Crucially, while sociological research highlights the administrative barriers faced by mobile populations—such as accessing social security—it rarely proposes quantitative methods to align service infrastructure with real-time mobility. Consequently, a disconnect persists between understanding migration patterns and adapting service delivery networks.

### 2.2 Optimization of Public Infrastructure and Service Centers
Facility location problems (FLP) in the public sector typically employ p-median or covering models to minimize access costs for target populations. In e-governance contexts, these models prioritize coverage maximization but predominantly operate under assumptions of static demand or historical growth averages. Literature on capacity planning often addresses fluctuations via queuing theory within fixed locations rather than dynamic reallocation across networks. Static models prove inadequate in scenarios of rapid urbanization, failing to prevent service bottlenecks. Furthermore, empirical applications of dynamic facility location to large-scale biometric identity systems remain limited. General-purpose models do not adequately address the specific operational nuance of identity systems, where demand varies fundamentally between initial enrolments and recurrent maintenance updates.

### 2.3 Machine Learning in Governance Systems
Data analytics in public administration increasingly leverages unsupervised learning, using algorithms like K-Means for policy targeting and anomaly detection for fraud identification. However, applying these techniques to national identity system logs is underexplored, as research typically prioritizes biometric matching performance over infrastructure operational health. Few studies utilize administrative metadata—like timestamps and transaction types—to model service center stress. Consequently, using clustering to segment centers based on operational profiles rather than citizen demographics remains a significant untapped opportunity for responsive governance.

### 2.4 Research Gap and Positioning of This Study
Synthesizing existing literature reveals a critical gap: the lack of integrated frameworks that utilize administrative transaction data for dynamic resource allocation in identity infrastructure. Current approaches rely on outdated census data or high-level proxies that fail to reflect specific administrative workloads. Moreover, existing optimization models rarely distinguish between heterogeneous demand types—enrolments versus updates—aggregating them into single volume counts that mask operational reality. This study addresses these limitations by leveraging granular transaction logs and unsupervised learning to classify operational stress. By bridging static planning with dynamic demographic reality, it positions administrative metadata as a central tool for operational efficiency in digital governance.
