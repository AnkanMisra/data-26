The operational efficiency of national identity systems is frequently challenged by the dynamic nature of internal migration, which renders static, census-based resource planning obsolete. This paper presents a data-driven framework to identify and quantify operational stress within the Aadhaar infrastructure by analyzing daily district and pincode-level transaction logs of enrolments, demographic updates, and biometric maintenance.

To address the limitations of raw volume metrics, a normalized Update-to-Enrolment Ratio (UER) is introduced, providing a standardized measure of center utilization patterns across diverse geographies. Applying unsupervised machine learning techniques—specifically K-Means clustering validated by silhouette analysis and Isolation Forest for anomaly detection—the study classifies administrative units into three distinct operational profiles, identifying a critical 12.6% of centers as high-stress migrant hubs and flagging 331 units with anomalous operational patterns.

The analysis reveals that update-driven demand in specific urban corridors significantly outstrips enrolment activity, while temporal analysis highlights seasonal biometric surges of approximately 300%. These factors create localized infrastructure bottlenecks that remain undetected by aggregate reporting. These results demonstrate the potential of utilizing administrative metadata for dynamic resource allocation, offering a scalable methodology for policymakers to optimize the distribution of biometric service centers in response to demographic shifts.
